In the Project0, We are trying to extract information from the PDF file and insert it into a SQLITE database named 'normanpd.db'.

The PDF file is cleaned using python and the data is formated into list of rows.

## Data
The Norman, Oklahoma police department regularly reports incidents, arrests, and other activities. This data is hosted on [their website](https://www.normanok.gov/public-safety/police-department/crime-prevention-data/department-activity-reports) which is distributed to the public in the form of PDF files.
In the project, we buid a function which uses only incidents pdf.

Example [incident PDF](https://www.normanok.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2022-02/2022-02-01_daily_incident_summary.pdf).
